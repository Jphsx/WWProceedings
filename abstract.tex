 The study showcases the approaches towards lepton identification and $\gamma\gamma$ mitigation at center-of-mass energy $\sqrt{s} = 500$ GeV for semileptonic WW decays at the ILC. The analysis is performed using fully simulated Standard Model Monte Carlo events with the ILD detector concept and emphasizes the measurement of the W mass. The mass measurement is performed through the identification of a lepton and treatment of the remaining system as the hadronic W-boson. Only the most favorable beam polarization scenario for WW production is considered. The resulting detector performance benchmark obtained, with an integrated luminosity of $1600 \, \, \text{fb}^{-1}$, is the statistical error on the W mass of $\Delta M_W\text{(stat.)} =  2.4 $ MeV and a relative statistical error on the WW cross-section of $\Delta \sigma / \sigma \text{(stat.)} = 0.036\% $.
