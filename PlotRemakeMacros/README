**Some macros here plot to hard coded spaces only on laptop 
There were extra workspaces for tau optimization and qq optimization that i worked on outside of git repo


macro.C remakes the lepEnergy and matching angle plots from a root file on my laptop


macro.sh runs other old scripts to remake stuff
macro.sh needs to be run on desy
The Generator mass diff for various ycuts and the wmass distribution with optimal ycut and 1e-3 (no y cut)
these plots can be made from the location
ILDbench_WWqqlnu/macros/WqqJetOptimizationmacros/plotter.C

I modified plotter.C to output a file optplots.C and have copied the file locally for ease

macro2.C runs over optplots.C locally and remakes the qq optimzation plots


for cut flow
I modified stackplot.c to output a file that is copied locally to be run in a macro script
/afs/desy.de/user/a/anguiano/work/repos/ILDbench_WWqqlnu/macros/v2Analysis/stacks/stackplot.c


For the W mass fit plots:
The files to reproduce these have all been copied to the fitremake directory
The fit on "data" comes from WWbenchmark/tempFIles on my laptop, 
The fit is performed by RooFitMacro.C and runs over the eventSel files that have been copied into the repository

The toy fit runs over the file generated by generateW script and is performed with the wfit.C macro
The toy fit code comes from the CompPaper or Proceedings project in the ExamSlides directory




macro4.C runs of optplots and stackout and generates the gen mass difference plot 
 the no cut dist is qqmunu with no overlay removal and no selection
 the w/ cut dist is qqmunu with overlay removal and selction applied

i think maybe the original gen mass diff plot was made somewhere with the fit files, i cant figure out where though
this plot is my best shot at a reproduction of the old one
