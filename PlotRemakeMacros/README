**Some macros here plot to hard coded spaces only on laptop 
There were extra workspaces for tau optimization and qq optimization that i worked on outside of git repo


macro.C remakes the lepEnergy and matching angle plots from a root file on my laptop


macro.sh runs other old scripts to remake stuff
macro.sh needs to be run on desy
The Generator mass diff for various ycuts and the wmass distribution with optimal ycut and 1e-3 (no y cut)
these plots can be made from the location
ILDbench_WWqqlnu/macros/WqqJetOptimizationmacros/plotter.C

I modified plotter.C to output a file optplots.C and have copied the file locally for ease

macro2.C runs over optplots.C locally and remakes the qq optimzation plots


for cut flow
I modified stackplot.c to output a file that is copied locally to be run in a macro script
/afs/desy.de/user/a/anguiano/work/repos/ILDbench_WWqqlnu/macros/v2Analysis/stacks/stackplot.c
